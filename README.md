Further improvement of a NO to NO2 converter for CE-DOAS measurements
======================================================================

This is my Bachelorthesis form the year 2016. It is concerned with the
improvement of the above mentioned converter. A CE-DOAS instrument is
used to determine atmospheric trace gases, in my case nitrogen dioxide
(NO2). Unfortunately in the current configuration it is not possible
to measure nitrogen monoxide directly. Hence the need for a
converter.

The thesis covers the basic principle for DOAS measurements, the
chemical background needed for the conversion and some calibration
measurements including the evaluations.
