\section{Acknowledgement}
\label{sec:acknowledgement}

I would like to express my sincere gratitude towards Dr.\ Denis PÃ¶hler
and Dr.\ Martin Horbanski, who supported me on my whole way to this
thesis helping me with the construction, the debugging and the
interpretation. I want to thank them especially for accepting the time
consuming task of reading this thesis beforehand and providing me with
valuable feedback. Additional thanks is due to Martin for his
willingness to drive me around a whole day for my vehicle
measurements. I would also like to cordially thank Prof.\ Dr.\ Ulrich
Platt, who took me on to tackle this topic and was always more than
happy to share his deep understanding of the physical and chemical
relations used in the construction of this converter. Last but not
least, I would like to thank Prof.\ Dr.\ Thomas Wagner who volunteered
to be my second referee.
