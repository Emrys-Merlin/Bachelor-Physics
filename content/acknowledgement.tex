\section{Acknowledgement}
\label{sec:acknowledgement}

I would like to express my sincere gratitude towards Dr.\ Denis PÃ¶hler
and Dr.\ Martin Horbanski who supported me on my way to this
thesis. Without them I would have a very hard time debugging and
interpreting many of my results. Additional pointers concerning
construction and setup tips made these measurements possible.  I want
to thank them especially for accepting the time consuming task of
reading this thesis beforehand and providing me with valuable
feedback. I would also like to cordially thank Prof.\ Dr.\ Ulrich
Platt who made the topic of this thesis possible and was always more
than happy to share his deep understanding of the physical relations
used in the construction of this converter. Last but not least, I
would like to thank Prof.\ Dr.\ Thomas Wagner who volunteered to be my
second referee on rather short notice.
