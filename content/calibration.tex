\subsection{Pure nitrogen monoxide measurements with synthetic air}
\label{sec:no}

After confirming that the generator produced a clean ozone stream, I
turned towards the question, whether it is possible to actually
measure \ch{NO} or not. Furthermore, I wanted to compare the
experimentally necessary reaction tube length to the computed value in
Section~\ref{sec:requirements}.

\subsubsection{Setup}
\label{sec:no-setup}

In order to be able to measure the nitrogen monoxide concentration
directly without additional corrections and computations, I had to
make sure that the used sample air was nitrogen dioxide free. This
lead to the setup depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:no-setup}. I used
synthetic air and \ch{NO} calibration gas with a known \ch{NO}
concentration ($c = \SI{8.177}{ppm}$) together with a mass flow
controller to generate synthetic sample air with a precisely known
\ch{NO} concentration. In order to minimize the influence on the
pressure inside the measurement cell, I decided to overflow the air
inlet instead of bypassing the cavity pump as is done during a helium
calibration. Thus the synthetic air flow was set to
$\Phi_{\text{air}}$ to \SI{3}{\liter\per\minute}. The instrument
itself was in the standard setup described in
Section~\ref{sec:inclusion}, except for the reaction tube length which
was varied between \SI{5}{\meter}, \SI{10}{\meter} and
\SI{15}{\meter}. For each of these lengths I varied the \ch{NO}
calibration gas flow between \num{0} and
\SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}. As zero air I used ambient lab air
together with a zero air cartridge.

  \label{fig:no-setup}
\end{figure}

In order to compare the measured \ch{NO} concentration to the actual
concentration in the air stream,the applied \ch{NO} flow was converted
to a concentration using the following formula
\begin{align}
  c_{\ch{NO}} = c \cdot \frac{\Phi_{\ch{NO}}}{\Phi_{\text{air}} +
  \Phi_{\ch{NO}}}. \label{eq:c-flow}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Results}
\label{sec:no-results}

Figure~\ref{fig:ts} shows the time series of the \ch{NO} and \ch{O3}
concentration. Each of the three clusters corresponds; from left to
right, to the reaction tube length of \SI{5}{\meter}, \SI{10}{\meter}
and \SI{15}{\meter}. Looking at the ozone concentration on the
left-hand side, it can be seen that its concentration is constant
within its error margins. These, however, are large. This is to be
expected, as the absorption cross section of \ch{O3} in the visual
spectrum is weak compared to the cross section of \ch{NO2} and has
almost no differential structure. Nevertheless, the ozone level seems
acceptably stable, which indicates that not too many ozone destroying
reactions take place, even in the presence of high \ch{NO}
concentrations. This is again what I expected in this very pure sample
air, which should only allow for the oxidation of \ch{NO}. Lastly, the
shape of the ozone time series does not seem to depend on the reaction
tube length.

Looking at the \ch{NO} time series on the right-hand side of
Figure~\ref{fig:ts} the overall shape of the three measurements is
seen to be similar. For the reaction tube length of
$l= \SI{5}{\meter}$ there are slight deviations. The rising flanks
take longer to reach a stable plateau than during the other two
measurements. Furthermore, the first three plateaus are not visible,
however, the reason for this lies in the fact that they were skipped
during the measurement procedure. The behavior of the rising flanks
cannot simply be explained by a too short reaction tube. If this were
the case, the depicted equilibria should all just lay lower, as the
reaction dynamic equilibrium would set for a lower, but
\emph{constant} \ch{NO2} concentration. Interestingly on the falling
flanks the equilibria are reached instantaneously (the small drop at
\SI{50}{ppb} being a human error). One possible explanation might lie
in the adsorption behavior of teflon. For example, if the ozone were
to be adsorbed to the tube walls, this could lead to an effective
increase in ozone concentration, accelerating the reaction and thus
compensating the too short tube length. If, additionally, the
adsorption time scale were in the order of magnitude of the dwell time
per set flow, this could explain why there are slowly increasing
flanks, while the falling flanks stabilize quickly. In the first case
the adsorbed ozone would have to build up because of the increased
concentration, in the second case there would already be enough ozone
adsorbed. Testing this idea was sadly outside the scope of this thesis
which means that for the following measurements I could only accept
this oddity and decided to work with longer tube lengths
(i.\,e.~$l = \SI{10}{\meter}$), which seem to not express this
behavior.

    \ch{NO} flow. All data points were linearly interpolated. The
    results can also be found in the plot.}
  \label{fig:no-length}
\end{figure}

Comparing next the \ch{NO2} plateaus between multiple tube lengths, it
seems that the concentrations seem to coincide. Averaging them and
plotting them against the tube length yields
Figure~\ref{fig:no-length}, which confirms this assertion. The data
points at corresponding flows were linearly interpolated to make
drifts more tangible. The fits were also plotted in the figure. The
interpolation showed that the slope was undiscernible from zero in
each case. At the \SI{5}{\meter} setting one of the red and one of the
violet data points seem to be off. These two data points correspond to
the rising flanks discussed extensively above. It seems that at these
two data points the equilibrium had not been reached and I averaged
too early.

Since Figure~\ref{fig:no-length} indicated that the measured
concentrations are tube length independent (except for the two
outliers), I can use all of them to research the correlation between
the measured concentrations and the ones computed from the flow by
Equation~\eqref{eq:c-flow}. The result can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:no-calib} together with a linear regression. The
regression formula yields

\begin{align*}
  y = \num{0.994 \pm 0.002}  \cdot x -\num{0.002 \pm 0.058},
\end{align*}
with a Pearson's r of 0.994. This further underlines the high
correlation between the measured and the calculated data.

  \caption{Correlation plot of the computed and the measured \ch{NO}
    concentration.}
  \label{fig:no-calib}
\end{figure}

Thus, the deviation between the measured and computed concentration
lies in the per mill regime. Under these controlled conditions the
converter works and does not introduce tangible systematic
errors. Figure~\ref{fig:ts} implies that a \SI{10}{\meter} reaction
tube is appropriate for the setup and will therefore be used for the
following experiments.
