\subsection{Comparison to chemiluminescence measurements}
\label{sec:cld}

After having assured the functionality of our converter in the lab
environment, we wanted to use it with ambient air. We wanted to try
out the alternating measurement procedure described in the previous
section and compare our results to another Nitrogen Monoxide
measurement instrument, a chemiluminescence monitor. This allowed us
to use ambient air as our \ch{NO} source while simultaneously being
able to check our results with a well established measurement method.

\subsubsection{Setup}
\label{sec:cld-setup}

The cavity and the chemiluminescence monitor (Eco Physics CLD 770 AL
ppt Chemiluminescence \ch{NO} Analyzer) were both setup at the
height laboratory at the Institute for Environmental Physics. We used
a tripod on the roof together with two teflon tubes to make sure to
sample at the same spot with both instruments.

We set up the cavity as described in Section~\ref{sec:inclusion}. For
each spectrum we sampled 3000 spectra at an exposure time of
\SI{10}{\milli\second}. Furthermore we used a purge time of
\SI{30}{\second} after Ozone switches. This time might have been taken
too short, as Section~\ref{sec:switch} indicates, as some residual
Ozone might have rested in the sample line.

To account for slight differences in the path length and flows in the
two instruments, we decided to comput \SI{30}{\minute} averages for
the comparison. The measurements depicted below were taken during the
day of January 22 and January 25, 2016. In between, there was a
malfunction of the chemiluminescence monitor, such that we do not have
any values from that period.

\subsubsection{Results}
\label{sec:cld-results}

The time series of the two measurements can be found in
Figure~\ref{fig:corr-ts}. As can be seen, the qualitative form of the
DOAS results is in good accordance with the chemiluminescence results.
However, there seems to be an offset and the DOAS concentration is
systematically lower than the chemiluminescence concentration. This
relation is also plainly visible in the correlation plot in
Figure~\ref{fig:cld-corr}. The measurements are very well correlated
and can be easily fitted by a linear regression, but it has an offset
and a slope differing from unity:

\begin{align*}
  y = \SI{1.38}{{ppb}\tothe{-1}} \cdot x + 3.8.
\end{align*}

There were two avenues we took in an attempt to understand these
findings. Both of them follow arguments already layed out in
Section~\ref{sec:switch}. The first consists in the observation, that
we used the \ch{NO} calibration gas container to calibrate the
chemiluminescence display (cld). If some of the \ch{NO} had been converted
to \ch{NO2}, we would have an error in the chemiluminescence
calibration, which would lead to lower cld results. Using the results
of the previous section, we can compute that we have about \SI{420}{ppb}
\ch{NO2} in the container, if all of it stemmed from \ch{NO} this
would introduce an error of about \SI{5}{\percent} (the calibration
concentration given was $c = \SI{8.177}{ppm}$). This is not enough to
explain the descripancy. Together with the fact that we cannot
explain, how the transition from \ch{NO} to \ch{NO2} could occur, we
discard this approach.

    chemiluminescence monitor (CLD). Each data point depicts a
    \SI{30}{\minute} average.}

\end{figure}

The second avenue we took, was to look at the purge time.
Section~\ref{sec:switch} suggests that \SI{30}{\second} purge time is
not enough after the Ozone switch was turned off. Thus we can expect
the measured \ch{NO2} intensities to be too large. One observation
pointing towards the influence of this effect ist, that we measures
negative \ch{NO} concentrations (to a minimum of \SI{-1.54}{ppb}) with
this method, which is of course absurd. In the previous section we
suggest, that hopefully the surplus \ch{NO2} signal does not depend
too strongly on the \ch{NO} concentration. If this assumption is
correct, we expect to be able to mitigate the effects by lowering the
\ch{NO2} signal by \SI{1.55}{ppb}, which corresponds surprisingly well
to the negative offset of our data. This \emph{tail corrected} data
set was then again correlated with the chemiluminescence data. The
result can also be found in Figure~\ref{fig:cld-corr}. The linear
regression follows the formula
\begin{align*}
  y = \SI{1.38}{ppb\tothe{-1}} \cdot x + 1.67.
\end{align*}
So we see that this tail correction has only an effect on the
intercept of our regression. This is expected as the constant lowering
of the \ch{NO2} signal increases the computed \ch{NO} signal by the
same amount and thus all data points are only shifted to the
right. Hence the slope of the regression is still off. Clearly the
aprroaches utilized here were too simplistic to account for all
effects. Further investigations are necessary to understand the
corrections necessary, possibly the offset might be computed by
analizing surrounding \ch{NO_x} values. This varying \ch{NO2}
correction could also influence the slope of the
regression. Additionally the chemiluminescence monitor has the
disadvantage that it does not write raw measurement data and rejects
data if it suspects the values to be negative (which can easily happen due
to a shift of the calibration). In this case the monitor only returns
the constant value zero, which has then to be taken care of. 

All in all it seems that there a few more stumbling blocks ahead
before this alternating measurement procedure is ready for productive
use. The behaviour of our converter after an Ozone switch have to be
characterized thoroughly to explain and cope with all the observed
effects.
