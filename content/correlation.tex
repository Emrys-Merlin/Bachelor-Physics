\subsection{Comparison to chemiluminescence measurements}
\label{sec:cld}

After having assured the functionality of the converter in the lab
environment, I wanted to use it with ambient air. I wanted to try out
the alternating measurement mode described in the previous section and
compare the results to another nitrogen monoxide measurement
instrument, a chemiluminescence monitor (or display, short: cld). This
made it possible to work in a more realistic setting while
simultaneously being able to verify the converter results.

\subsubsection{Setup}
\label{sec:cld-setup}

The cavity and the chemiluminescence monitor (Eco Physics CLD 770 AL
ppt Chemiluminescence \ch{NO} Analyzer) were both setup at the rooftop
laboratory at the Institute for Environmental Physics. I used a
tripod on the roof together with two teflon tubes to make sure to
sample at the same spot with both instruments.

I set up the cavity as described in Section~\ref{sec:inclusion}. For
each spectrum I sampled 3000 spectra at an exposure time of
\SI{10}{\milli\second}. Furthermore, I used a purge time of
\SI{30}{\second} after ozone switches. This time was set too short to
account for the slowly falling tail, as Section~\ref{sec:switch}
indicates.

In order to account for slight differences in the path length and
flows in the two instruments, I decided to compute \SI{30}{\minute}
averages for the comparison. These measurements were taken during the
day of January 22 and January 25, 2016.

\subsubsection{Results}
\label{sec:cld-results}

The time series of the two measurements can be found in
Figure~\ref{fig:corr-ts}. As can be seen, the qualitative form of the
DOAS results is in good accordance with the chemiluminescence results.
However, there seems to be an offset and the DOAS concentration is
systematically lower than the chemiluminescence concentration. This
relation is also plainly visible in the correlation plot in
Figure~\ref{fig:cld-corr}. The measurements are very well correlated
and can be easily fitted by a linear regression, but the line has an
offset and a slope, which is differing from unity:

\begin{align*}
  y = \SI{1.38}{{ppb}\tothe{-1}} \cdot x + 3.8.
\end{align*}

There were two avenues I followed in an attempt to understand these
findings. Both of them follow arguments already layed out in
Section~\ref{sec:switch}. The first consists in the observation, that
the \ch{NO} calibration gas container was used to calibrate the
chemiluminescence display. If some of the \ch{NO} had been converted
to \ch{NO2}, there would be an error in the chemiluminescence
calibration, which would lead an overestimation of the \ch{NO}
concentration by the cld. Using the \ch{NO2}
offset found in the previous section, one can compute that there is
about \SI{420}{ppb} \ch{NO2} in the cylinder, if all of it stemmed
from \ch{NO} this would introduce an error of about \SI{5}{\percent}
(the calibration concentration given was $c = \SI{8.177}{ppm}$). This
is not enough to explain the discrepancy. Together with the fact that
I could not explain, how the transition from \ch{NO} to \ch{NO2} could
occur, I discarded this approach.

The second avenue I took, was to look at the purge time.
Section~\ref{sec:switch} suggests that \SI{30}{\second} purge time is
not enough after the ozone switch has been turned off. Thus one would
expect the measured \ch{NO2} intensities to be overestimated. One
observation pointing towards the influence of this effect ist, that I
measured negative \ch{NO} concentrations (to a minimum of
\SI{-1.54}{ppb}), which is of course absurd. In the previous section I
suggest, that the surplus \ch{NO2} signal does not depend too strongly
on the \ch{NO} concentration. If this assumption is correct, one will
expect to be able to mitigate the effects by lowering the \ch{NO2}
signal by $\bar c_s = \SI{1.55}{ppb}$ (c.\,f.\
Equation~\eqref{eq:offset} on page~\pageref{eq:offset}), which
corresponds surprisingly well to the negative offset of the measured
data. This \emph{tail corrected} data set was then again correlated
with the chemiluminescence data. The result can also be found in
Figure~\ref{fig:cld-corr}. The linear regression follows the formula
\begin{align*}
  y = \SI{1.38}{ppb\tothe{-1}} \cdot x + 1.67.
\end{align*}
So the tail correction has only an effect on the
intercept of the regression. This is expected as the constant lowering
of the \ch{NO2} signal increases the computed \ch{NO} signal by the
same amount and thus all data points are shifted to the
right. Hence the slope of the regression is still off. Clearly the
aprroach utilized here was too simplistic to account for all
effects. Further investigations are necessary to understand the
corrections necessary. Possibly, the \ch{NO2} correction can be
computed utilizing the previous \ch{NO_x} data point, thus indirectly
taking \ch{NO} influences on the offset into account. This varying \ch{NO2}
correction could then also influence the slope of the
regression. In order to investigate this further I suggest to perform
additional decay measurements as proposed in the previous section.

All in all it seems that there are a few more stumbling blocks ahead
before this alternating measurement mode is ready for productive
use. The behaviour of the converter after an ozone switch has to be
characterized thoroughly to explain and cope with all the observed
effects.
