\subsection{Vehicle measurements}
\label{sec:vehicle}

During this last measurement, we wanted to test our converter under
the conditions of in vivo vehicle measurements. The great advantage in
this setting is, that the European guidelines for nitrogen oxide
emission (the so called Euro 6 norms) are only concerned with \ch{NO_x}
(c.\,f.~\cite{eu}), i.\,e.\ in this case we do not need to separate
\ch{NO} from \ch{NO2}. Still we wanted to compare our \ch{NO_x}
results to the results of pure \ch{NO2} measurements to gauge the
influence of the additional \ch{NO} on the air pollution. Therefore we
decided to use two cavities in parallel. One with our converter, the
other one without. With this very comfortable setup, we could even
compute the \ch{NO} concentration without having to switch the ozone,
which mitigated all the undesired effects described in the previous
two sections.

\subsubsection{Setup}
\label{sec:vehicle-setup}

For the measurement we loaded a car with both cavities
and positioned the pickup tube directly above the front license
plate. The \ch{NO_x} cavity was setup according to
Section~\ref{sec:inclusion} with an exposure time of
\SI{10}{\milli\second} and 1000 scans per spectrum leading to a time
resolution of \SI{1}{\second}. As \ch{NO2} cavity we used the
AQM$_{\text{Tec}}$ Compact Cavity, which is the standard cavity at the
Institute for Environmental Physics for \ch{NO2} measurements in urban
areas and especially vehicle measurements. This cavity operated at a
\SI{2}{\second} time resolution and had the further advantage of
possessing a \ch{CO2} sensor. This allowed us to compute ratios
between nitrogen (di-)oxide and carbon dioxide, which is a good
measure for the emission per (gazoline) consumption.

The measurements took place on Friday, February 05, 2016 in Heidelberg
between 11:00 and 16:30. From 12:15 to 13:45, we operated both
cavities in \ch{NO2} mode to test for systematic deviations. From
15:00 to 16:00, we positioned our measurement vehicle next to the
Heidelberg air quality measurement station to be able to compare our
\ch{NO} and \ch{NO2} values to the ones of the station as a test of
reliability. In between we followed 30 vehicles throughout
Heidelberg for {\nfrac{} 1/2}~\si{\minute} to \SI{10}{\minute} each
and tried to stay within their exhaust plume. Since the two cavities'
clocks could not be fully synchronized, the time series had to be
matched in the evaluation process. This was done manually using succinct
peaks in the plots.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Results}
\label{sec:vehicle-results}

In Figure~\ref{fig:hd-comparison} one can see the comparison of the
measured \ch{NO2} concentrations of the two used cavities. It is
clearly visible that ther is no qualitative difference between the
two. However, our \ch{NO_x} cavity measured slightly lower
concentrations than the \ch{NO2} cavity with a mean difference of
$\Delta = \SI{0.43\pm0.01}{ppb}$. Absolutely speaking this is not a
large difference, but the question remains why it exists at all. The
most probable explanation is that the used zero air spectrum of the
\ch{NO_x} cavity was not completely trace gas free. One reason that
points towards this direction is, that in the \ch{NO_x} measurement
mode, we have a constant flow through the zero air input, as this is
the input for the ozone generator, too. Thus the zero air filter is much
more strained than it would be in a cavity without \ch{NO_x}
mode. Since the cavity had been thoroughly tested for multiple
weeks, a saturation or starting effects of a saturation of
the Silica gel or the activated carbon seem plausible.

For the comparison to the air quality measurement station, we should
keep this effect in mind as the deviation is large enough to be of
interest. During the vehicle measurements it should well be
negligible as the measured concentrations lay in the region of several
hundered \si{ppb} (see below). Additionally, the value is small
compared to other uncertainties affecting the concentrations there
(e.\,g.\ the influence of the varying distance to the measured
vehicle or of the neighbouring traffic).

    \ch{NO} concentration next to the Umweltlandesamt air quality
    measurement station in Heidelberg.}
  \label{fig:umba}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:umba} contains the time series of the measured
\ch{NO_x} and \ch{NO_2} and the computed \ch{NO} during our stay next
to the Heidelberg air quality measurement station. For moderate
\ch{NO2} concentrations between \num{10} and \SI{20}{ppb} the
\ch{NO_x} curve almost coincides with the \ch{NO2} curve. Only during
peaks we have a stronger separation and the \ch{NO_x} concentration
rises occasionally twice as high as the \ch{NO2} concentration. The
time series makes clear that neglecting \ch{NO} values while
estimating \ch{NO_x} pollution in urban areas can lead to serious
underestimation.

In a next step we computed the average concentrations for all three
time series and compared them to the station data taken
from~\cite{umba}. The results can be found in Table~\ref{tab:umba}. We
see that we have a systematic deviation from the station,
but our values lie in the same region. The standard CE-DOAS method has
been thoroughly tested during the last decades and is known to produce
solid results in good agreement with the measurement stations. Thus
the deviation of the \ch{NO2} average points towards outer
influences as explanations for the deviation. Indeed our pickup tube
was about \SI{3}{\meter} away from the station inlet and approximately
\SI{1}{\meter} lower (which means also closer to the driving
surface). These differences in the exact location can easily account for
our measured derivations.

Nevertheless, the main result remains that under field conditions in
ambient air our measured \ch{NO_x} or respectively computed \ch{NO}
values are comparable to the ones of the station, thus indicating once
more that our converter works and that if there is a second cavity at
hand the setup seems to work very well for indirect \ch{NO}
measurements. Still some more (and longer) measurements would be
advisable to aquire more data points for enough statistics to make a
comparison between the converter method and other established \ch{NO}
measurement methods resilient.

  \label{tab:umba}
\end{table}

In between the above described experiments, we measured \num{30}
vehicles within Heidelberg. The main result is that we have a large
discrepancy between the \ch{NO2} and \ch{NO_x} values. During peaks
the \ch{NO_x} values exceed the \ch{NO2} values by far.

As an in depth analysis of all vehicles would most likely go beyond
the scope of this thesis and furthermore miss the point of
characterising and analyzing our converter, we will restrict our
attention to two vehicles. We chose these by reason of pursuit time
and distinguishability from background and ended up with one Diesel
car and a public-transit bus. These will be discussed in detail below.
The first example is a Mercedes B180 CDI.\@ The time series is
depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:mercedes-ts} and a picture of the vehicle
together with the surrounding traffic is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bus}
left hand side. There are 5 to 6 acceleration periods visible and most prominent
in the \ch{NO_x} time series. We see that the \ch{NO_2} values vary
the least and are between a factor 4 and a factor 9 smaller than the
\ch{NO_x} values during peaks. In the valleys between peaks, the
\ch{NO_x} approaches the \ch{NO2}, but is still significantly
higher. The \ch{CO2} time series has the same overall appearance as
the \ch{NO_x} curve. If we correct the concentrations for background
pollution and compute averages, we are able compare the nitrogen
(di-)oxide emission to the carbon dioxide emission. The results can
be found in Table~\ref{tab:mercedes-bus}. We see that there is one
order of magnitude difference between the two ratios, which again underlines
the blatant underestimation of the vehicle emissions if only \ch{NO2}
values are taken into account.

\end{figure}

The second example was the bus of the Heidelberg public-transport
system (c.\,f.\ Fig.~\ref{fig:bus} right hand side). We followed it
for \SI{10}{\minute} through mostly suburban
areas with almost no traffic. Therefore, the values depicted in the
time series in Figure~\ref{fig:bus-ts} should give a rather pure
picture of the bus's emission. During our pursuit the bus stopped at 6
bus stops, which explain the many acceleration periods depicted. The
additional ones are due to crossroads and traffic
lights. As before in the Mercedes case, we see that the \ch{NO_x}
concentration varies the most and the \ch{CO2} curve follows it
in the same general form. The \ch{NO2} concentration is the most
stable, but shows still a peak of over \SI{2500}{ppb}. In absolute
terms, we see that the bus has a factor 2 to 3 higher \ch{NO_x}
emission peaks than the Mercedes. During the short periods of time in
between bus stops, the emission drops drastically and is in a
comparable range to the valleys of the Mercedes time series, however,
since there are so many bus stops on the route the emission during
acceleration makes up the major part of the pollution. Looking at the
ratios in Table~\ref{tab:mercedes-bus}, we see that the bus has a
three times higher \ch{NO2} ratio, but the \ch{NO_x} ratios do not
differ within the uncertainties. This can be explained by realizing
that the bus naturally has a far higher consumption than an average
street car. This directly leads to higher emissions, especialle higher
\ch{CO2} emissions, which cancel out the larger nitrogen (di-)oxide
values.

All in all these measurements yield two important take home
messages. First of all, we have further evidence that our converter
works and that it produces additional detectable \ch{NO2} in
the cavity. An interesting question for further investigation would be
to find out, whether the converter is fast enough to completely
convert \ch{NO_x} peaks with a maximum of over \SI{3500}{ppb}. Dealing
with such magnitudes (as is realistic as shown in the Bus case), the
converter could run in a region where the ozone concentration cannot
be assumed to be constant anymore and the reaction speed should
diminish. Since we do not know the conversion ratio for such high
concentrations, the above \ch{NO_x} values should be handled with care
and be understood as a lower bound for the emission. In any case, the
second important message is, that portable \ch{NO} measurement
instruments are important for in vivo vehicle measurements, as pure
\ch{NO2} instruments may underestimate the \ch{NO_x} emission by a
factor of 10.
