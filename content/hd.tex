\subsection{Vehicle measurements}
\label{sec:vehicle}

During this last measurement, we wanted to test our converter under
the conditions of in vivo vehicle measurements. The great advantage in
this setting is, that all European guidelines for Nitrogen Oxide
emission only talk about \ch{NO_x} (c.\,f.~\cite{eu}), i.\,e.\ in this
case we do not need to separate \ch{NO2} from \ch{NO}. Still we wanted
to compare our \ch{NO_x} results to the results of pure \ch{NO2}
measurements to gauge the influence of the additional \ch{NO} on the
air pollution. Therefore we decided to use two cavities in
parallel. One with our converter, the other one without. With this
very comfortable setup, we could even compute the \ch{NO}
concentration without having to switch the Ozone, which mitigated all
the undesired effects described in the previous two sections.

\subsubsection{Setup}
\label{sec:vehicle-setup}

For the measurement we loaded a car (Ford Focus) with both cavities
and positioned the pickup tube directly above the front license
plate. The \ch{NO_x} cavity was setup according to
Section~\ref{sec:inclusion} with an exposure time of
\SI{10}{\milli\second} and 1000 scans per spectrum leading to a time
resolution of \SI{1}{\second}. As \ch{NO2}
cavity we used the AQM$_{\text{Tec}}$ Compact Cavity, which is the
standard cavity at the Institute for Environmental Physics for
measurements in urban areas and especially vehicle measurements. This
cavity operated at a \SI{2}{\second} timely resolution. The
measurement took place on Friday, February 05, 2016 in Heidelberg
between 11:00 and 16:30. From 12:15 to 13:45, we operated both
cavities in \ch{NO2} mode to test for systematic deviations. From
15:00 to 16:15, we positioned our measurement car next to the
Heidelberg air quality measurement station to be able to compare our
\ch{NO} and \ch{NO2} values to the ones of the station as a measure of
reliability. In between we followed various vehicles throughout
Heidelberg between {\nfrac{} 1/2}~\si{\minute} and \SI{10}{\minute}
and tried to stay within their exhaust plume. Since the two cavities's
clocks could not be fully synchronized, the timeseries had to be
matched in the evaluation step. This was done manually using succinct
peaks in the plots.

\subsubsection{Results}
\label{sec:vehicle-results}

In Figure~\ref{fig:hd-comparison} you can see the comparison of the
measured \ch{NO2} concentrations of the two used cavities. It is
clearly visible that ther is no qualitative difference between the
two. However, our \ch{NO_x} cavity measures slightly lower
concentrations than the \ch{NO2} cavity with a mean difference of
$\Delta = \SI{0.43\pm0.01}{ppb}$. Absolutely speaking this is not a
large difference, but the question remains why it shows up at all. The
most probable explanation is that the used zero air spectrum of the
\ch{NO_x} cavity was not completely trace gas free. On reason that
points towards this direction is, that in the \ch{NO_x} measurement
mode, we have a constant flow through the zero air input, as this is
the input for the Ozone generator. Thus the zero air filters are much
more strained than they would be in a cavity without \ch{NO_x}
mode. Additionally the cavity had been thoroughly tested for multiple
weeks, such that a saturation or starting effects of a saturation of
the Silica gel or the activated carbon seem plausible.

  \label{fig:umba}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:umba} contains the timeseries of the measured
\ch{NO_x} and \ch{NO_2} and the computed \ch{NO} during our stay next
to the Heidelberg air quality measurement station. This time series is
representative for all the measurements we took that day. For moderate
\ch{NO2} concentrations between \num{10} and \SI{20}{ppb} the
\ch{NO_x} curve almost coincides with the \ch{NO2} curve. Only during
peaks we have a stronger separation and the \ch{NO_x} concentration
rises occasionally twice as high as the \ch{NO2} concentration. The
time series makes clear that neglecting \ch{NO} values while
estimating \ch{NO_x} pollution in urban areas can lead to
underestimation.

In a next step we computed the average concentrations for all three
time series and compared them to the station data taken
from~\cite{umba}. The results can be found in Table~\ref{tab:umba}. We
see that we have a systematic deviation from the station values,
but our values lie in the same region. The standard CE-DOAS method has
been thoroughly tested during the last decades and is known to produce
solid results ind good accordance with the measurement station. Thus
the deviation of the \ch{NO2} averages already points towards outer
influences, which can explain the deviations. Indeed our pickup tube
was about \SI{3}{\meter} away from the station inlet and approximately
\SI{1}{\meter} lower (which means also closer to the driving
surface). These differences in exact location can easily account for
our measured derivations.

Nevertheless, the main result stays that under field conditions in
ambient air our measured \ch{NO_x} or respectively computed \ch{NO}
values are comparable to the ones of the station, thus indicating once
more that our converter together with a second cavity seem to work as
a good setup for \ch{NO} measurements. Still some more (and longer)
measurements would be advisable to aquire more data points for enough
statistics to make a comparison between the DOAS method and other
established \ch{NO} measurement methods resilient.
