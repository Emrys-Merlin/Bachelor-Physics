\subsection{Vehicle measurements}
\label{sec:vehicle}

During this last measurement, I wanted to test the converter under the
conditions of in vivo vehicle measurements. The great advantage of
such measurements is that the European guidelines for nitrogen oxide
emission (the so called Euro 6 norms) are only concerned with
\ch{NO_x} (c.\,f.~\cite{eu}), i.\,e.\ in this case it is not necessary
to separate \ch{NO} from \ch{NO2}. Still, I wanted to compare the
\ch{NO_x} results to the results of pure \ch{NO2} measurements to
gauge the influence of the additional \ch{NO} on the air
pollution. Therefore, two cavities were used in parallel. One with the
converter, the other one without. With this very comfortable setup I
could even compute the \ch{NO} concentration without having to turn
the ozone on and off, which mitigated all the undesired effects
described in the previous two sections.

\subsubsection{Setup}
\label{sec:vehicle-setup}

For the measurement a car was loaded with both ICAD instruments and
the pickup tube was attached directly above the front license
plate. The main ideas behind the setup can be found in
Figure~\ref{fig:hd-principle}, where the institute's bus was equipped
with an ICAD instrument. The \ch{NO_x} cell was set up according to
Section~\ref{sec:inclusion} with an exposure time of
\SI{10}{\milli\second} and 100 scans per spectrum leading to a time
resolution of \SI{1}{\second}. As \ch{NO2} instrument I used the
AQM$_{\text{Tec}}$ Compact ICAD, which is the standard instrument at
the Institute for Environmental Physics for \ch{NO2} measurements in
urban areas and especially vehicle measurements. This \ch{NO2} ICAD
operated at a \SI{2}{\second} time resolution and had the further
advantage of possessing a \ch{CO2} sensor. This allowed the
computation of the ratios between nitrogen (di-)oxide and carbon
dioxide, which are a good measure for the emission per (gazoline)
consumption of the vehicles.

    instruments. The picture was provided by~\cite{denis}.}
  \label{fig:hd-principle}
\end{figure}

The measurements took place on Friday, February 05, 2016 in Heidelberg
between 11:00 and 16:30. From 12:15 to 13:45, I operated both
measurement cells in \ch{NO2} mode to test for systematic
deviations. From 15:00 to 16:00, the measurement vehicle was
positioned next to the Heidelberg air quality measurement station to
be able to compare the \ch{NO} and \ch{NO2} values to the ones of the
station as a test of reliability. In between, 30 vehicles were
observed throughout Heidelberg for {\nfrac{} 1/2}~\si{\minute} to
\SI{10}{\minute} each.  Since the two cavities' clocks could not be
fully synchronized, the time series had to be matched in the
evaluation process. This was done manually using succinct peaks in the
plots.

\subsubsection{Results}
\label{sec:vehicle-results}

In Figure~\ref{fig:hd-comparison} one can see that the measured
\ch{NO2} concentrations of the two cavities, which were then both
operated in \ch{NO2} mode. There seems to be no qualitative difference
between the two. However, the \ch{NO_x} cavity measured slightly lower
concentrations than the \ch{NO2} cavity. For a more precise analysis
the correlation between the two time series was
determined. Figure~\ref{fig:hd-corr} contains \SI{1}{\minute} averages
together with a linear regression, which follows the formula
\begin{align*}
  y = \num{0.99 \pm 0.01} \cdot x + \num{0.6 \pm 0.3}.
\end{align*}
Except for some data points on the left tail, the two time series seem
to be well correlated. The slope of the regression coincides with
unity within its uncertainty, but the intercept differs from
zero. Regarding the consequences of this finding, this offset is not
large absolutely speaking, but the question remains why it exists at
all. The most probable explanation is that the zero air spectrum used
in the evaluation of the \ch{NO_x} cavity was not completely trace gas
free. One reason that points towards this direction is that in the
\ch{NO_x} measurement mode there is a constant flow through the zero
air input, as this is the input for the ozone generator, too. Thus the
zero air filter is much more strained than it would be in a cavity
without \ch{NO_x} mode. Since the cavity had been thoroughly tested
for multiple weeks, starting effects of a saturation of the silica gel
or the activated carbon seem plausible.

For the comparison to the air quality measurement station, this effect
might be of interest as the deviation is large enough in this
case. During the vehicle measurements it should well be negligible as
the measured concentrations lay in the region of several hundered
\si{ppb} (see below). Additionally, the value is small compared to
other uncertainties affecting the concentrations there (e.\,g.\ the
influence of the varying distance to the measured vehicle or of the
neighbouring traffic).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \input{images/umba_ts}
  \caption{Timeseries of the \ch{NO_x}, \ch{NO2} and the computed
    \ch{NO} concentration next to the Umweltlandesamt air quality
    measurement station in Heidelberg.}
  \label{fig:umba}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:umba} contains the time series of the measured
\ch{NO_x} and \ch{NO_2} and the computed \ch{NO} during the stay next
to the Heidelberg air quality measurement station. For moderate
\ch{NO2} concentrations between \num{10} and \SI{20}{ppb} the
\ch{NO_x} curve almost coincides with the \ch{NO2} curve. Only during
peaks there is a stronger separation and the \ch{NO_x} concentration
rises occasionally twice as high as the \ch{NO2} concentration. The
time series makes clear that neglecting \ch{NO} values while
estimating \ch{NO_x} pollution in urban areas can lead to serious
underestimation.

In a next step I computed the average concentrations for all three
time series and compared them to the station data taken
from~\cite{umba}. The results can be found in Table~\ref{tab:umba}. It
shows that there is a systematic deviation from the station, but the
values lie in the same region. The standard ICAD method has been
thoroughly tested during the last decades and is known to produce
solid results in good agreement with the measurement stations. Thus
the deviation of the \ch{NO2} average points towards outer influences
as explanations for the deviation. Indeed the pickup tube was about
\SI{3}{\meter} away from the station inlet and approximately
\SI{1}{\meter} lower (which means also closer to the driving
surface). These differences in the exact location can easily account
for the measured derivation.

Nevertheless, the main result remains that under field conditions in
ambient air the measured \ch{NO_x} and computed \ch{NO}
values are comparable to the ones of the station. This indicates once
more that the converter works and that if there is a second cavity at
hand, the setup seems to work very well for indirect \ch{NO}
measurements. Still, some more (and longer) measurements would be
advisable to acquire more data points for enough statistics to make a
comparison between the cavity and the station resilient.

    instrument. The station data was taken from~\cite{umba}; no

  \label{tab:umba}
\end{table}

In between the above described experiments, \num{30} vehicles were
measured within Heidelberg. The main result is that there is a large
discrepancy between the \ch{NO2} and \ch{NO_x} values. During peaks
the \ch{NO_x} values exceed the \ch{NO2} values by far.

As an in depth analysis of all vehicles would most likely go beyond
the scope of this thesis and furthermore miss the point of
characterizing and analyzing the converter, I will restrict my
attention to two exemplary vehicles. I chose these by reason of
pursuit time and distinguishability from background and ended up with
one diesel car and a public-transit bus. The first example is a
Mercedes B180 CDI.\@ The time series is depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:mercedes-ts} and a picture of the vehicle together
with the surrounding traffic is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bus}
left-hand side. There are five to six acceleration periods visible and
most prominent in the \ch{NO_x} time series. The \ch{NO_2} values vary
the least and are between a factor four and a factor nine smaller than
the \ch{NO_x} values during peaks. In the valleys between peaks, the
\ch{NO_x} approaches the \ch{NO2}, but is still significantly
higher. The \ch{CO2} time series has the same overall appearance as
the \ch{NO_x} curve. For a quantitave analysis the nitrogen (di-)oxide
emission per carbon dioxide emission is computed. Using the official
\ch{CO2} efficiency classes an emission of
\SI{150}{\gram\per\kilo\meter} of \ch{CO2} for the car is
obtained. Together with the molar masses of the species this can be
converted to the emission of \ch{NO2} and \ch{NO_x} respectively. The
results can be found in Table~\ref{tab:mercedes-bus}. It shows that
there is one order of magnitude difference between the corresponding
\ch{NO2} and \ch{NOx} values, which again underlines the blatant
underestimation of the vehicle emissions if only \ch{NO2} values are
taken into account.

The second example is a bus of the Heidelberg public-transport system
(c.\,f.\ Fig.~\ref{fig:bus} right-hand side). It was traced for
\SI{10}{\minute} through mostly suburban areas with almost no
traffic. Therefore, the values depicted in the time series in
Figure~\ref{fig:bus-ts} should give a rather pure picture of the bus's
emission. During the pursuit the bus stopped at six bus stops, which
explains the many acceleration periods depicted. The additional ones
are due to crossroads and traffic lights. As before in the Mercedes
case, the \ch{NO_x} concentration varies the most and the \ch{CO2}
curve follows it in the same general form. The \ch{NO2} concentration
is the most stable, but shows still a peak of over \SI{2500}{ppb}. In
absolute terms, the bus has a factor two to three higher \ch{NO_x}
emission peaks than the Mercedes. During the short periods of time in
between bus stops, the emission drops drastically and is in a
comparable range to the valleys of the Mercedes time series. However,
since there are so many bus stops on the route the emission during
acceleration makes up the major part of the average emission. Looking
at the ratios and the emissions (using \SI{1060}{\gram\per\kilo\meter}
\ch{CO2}~\cite{denis}) in Table~\ref{tab:mercedes-bus} leads to the
conclusion that the bus has a three times higher \ch{NO2} ratio than
the Mercedes, but that the \ch{NO_x} ratios do not differ within the
uncertainties. This can be explained by realizing that the bus
naturally has a far higher consumption than an average street
car. This directly leads to higher emissions, especially higher carbon
dioxide emissions, which cancel out the larger nitrogen (di-)oxide
values. Looking at the absolute emissions, this becomes obvious and
the bus values are a magniute larger than the car values.

All in all these measurements yield two important
quintessences. First, there is further evidence that the converter
works and that it produces additional detectable \ch{NO2} in the
cavity. An interesting question for further investigation would be to
find out, whether the converter is fast enough to completely convert
\ch{NO_x} peaks with a maximum of over \SI{3500}{ppb}. Dealing with
such magnitudes (as is realistic as shown in the bus case), the
converter could run in a region where the ozone concentration cannot
be assumed to be constant anymore and the reaction speed should
diminish. The conversion ratio cannot be computed exactly in this
bounding case, but it should be lower than the approximated value
computed in Sectin~\ref{sec:requirements}. Thus the above \ch{NO_x}
values should be handled with care and be understood as a lower bound
for the emission. The second important message is that portable
\ch{NO} measurement instruments are important for in vivo vehicle
measurements, as pure \ch{NO2} instruments may underestimate the
\ch{NO_x} emission by a factor of ten.
