\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This Bachelor Thesis stands in a row of theses all concerned with the
improvement of nitrogen oxide detection capabilities of CE-DOAS
instruments. Nitrogen oxides (\ch{NO_x}) play an important role in the
atmospherical chemistry in urban areas (c.\,f.~\cite{roedel}) and are
a major air pollutant in German
cities(c.\,f.~\cite{no2schadstoff,who}). Together with other
volatile organic compounds, they can build up Ozone, leading to
higher health risks. Additionally, it is slightly toxic in its own
right.

In inhabitated areas, most nitrogen oxide is anthropogenic, as it is
easily generated during combustion processes, e.\,g.\ in car
engines. Strict regulation and monitoring by government agencies is
necessary to protect the air quality. However, the recent VW affair
shows that there is still lack of adequate monitoring
instruments. There is a need for mobile and reasonably priced measurement
units, which can be used to determine the \ch{NO_x} emissions under
live conditions; in the streets, during regular traffic.

A first succesful step towards such an instrument, is the compact
CE-DOAS instrument developed at the Institute of Environmental Physics
at Heidelberg University. With a led in the blue light spectrum, it
can determine nitrogen dioxide (\ch{NO2}) concentrations with a very
high accuracy, while being portable and easily installable in vehicles
for in vivo measurements. However, there is still room for
improvement. Nitrogen monoxide (\ch{NO}) is also a central component
in the atmospheric \ch{NO_x} equilibrium, but it can only be detected
in the ultraviolet wavelength range. This is a dilemma as UV leds are
still expensive and highly reflective mirrors in that range are even
more so, making such an upgrade unattractive. Luckily, there is a
workaround for this problem. There is a promising conversion from
\ch{NO} to \ch{NO2}, which would allow us to measure the concentration
indirectly. The details of this converter construction is the topic of
this thesis.

Zimmermann~\cite{zimmermann}, Gerick~\cite{gerick} and
Jegminat~\cite{bsc} have already established, that ambient air
together with a mercury lamp can be used to generate ozone, which in
turn triggers our desired conversion. However, there are still a few
stumbling blocks left. The ozone generatore produces \ch{NO2}, too,
which disturbs the measured \ch{NO_x} signals. Jegminat found that
this additional signal is due to laughing gas (\ch{N2O}), which is
very hard to filter. Therefore, this work explores the possibilities
of filtering the \ch{NO2} behind the generator, while avoiding the
removal of the necessary ozone. We use silica gel
as~\cite{ozone-silica} inidicates, that it will quickly be saturated
by ozone, while still being able to adsorb nitrogen dioxide.  We
confirm this hypothesis and determin the filtering efffects. After
having assured a clean ozone air stream we work with synthetic sample
air allowing for precisely controlled \ch{NO} concentrations and
determine the accuracy of our conversion in this pure \ch{NO}
setting. Afterwards we characterize the alternating measurement mode,
which switches between \ch{NO2} and \ch{NO}+\ch{NO2} measurements. We
are interested in necessary purge times in between measurements to
ensure that stable equilibria are reached. As it turns out ozone
adsorption at the teflon tubes might be a major caveat, when it comes
to quickly draining the system of it. If we stay at one measurement
mode (i.\,e. \ch{NO2} or \ch{NO_x}), no additional adsorption effect
seem to occur. Next, we conduct measurements using ambient air and
compare our results to well established a \ch{NO} measurement method,
a chemiluminescence monitor. Lastly, we turn our attention towards the
above mentioned possible application and perform vehicle measurements
within Heidelberg. We install our updated cavity together with a
second (pure \ch{NO2}) cavity in a car and measure the plume of ca.~30
vehicles. Additionally, we measure next to the Heidelberg air quality
measurement station, which allows us to compare our results to
official data.

In the following we will first discuss the necessary physical and
chemical background of our converter and the DOAS system
(Sec.~\ref{sec:theory}). This already shows some of the necessary
constraints for our setup, which we will then describe in detail in
Section~\ref{sec:setup}. Lastly, we describe all preformed experiments
in Section~\ref{sec:measurements} together with their results and their
interpretation.
