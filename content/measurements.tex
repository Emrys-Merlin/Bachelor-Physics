\section{Measurements}
\label{sec:measurements}

This section contains all the measurements conducted to characterize
and test our converter. To evaluate our measured spectra we used the
DOAS Intelligent System (DOASIS) software package~\cite{doasis} with
the ICAD evaluation script (v1.1) by M.\ Horbanski and the LP-DOAS
Data fitting script by D.\ PÃ¶hler. All used post processing and
plotting scripts can be found under~\cite{scripts}.
