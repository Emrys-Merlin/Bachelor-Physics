\subsection{Startup behaviour of the Ozone generator}
\label{sec:ozone}

During these first experiments, we wanted to assure that the Ozone
generator produces enough Ozone. More precisely we were interested,
whether the Ozone could penetrate the Silica gel and how long it would
take for it to succeed. In a last step we wanted to gauge the relation
between the Ozone production and the applied electrical current at the
Mercury lamp.

\subsubsection{Setup}
\label{sec:ozone-setup}

The following experiments were all conducted using the setup described
in Section~\ref{sec:ozone-setup}. Since the cuvette had to be entered
in and removed from the lightpath manually, the time resolution had to
be reduced to \SI{5}{\minute}. In a first step we measured the startup
curve of the Ozone after a one week stop of the generator. Secondly, we
researched the startup time necessary after shorter stops. Lastly, we
noted the influence of the lamp current on the Ozone concentration.
Using this setup it was impossible to measure the generator's
\ch{NO2} productoin. Since the concentration should
be around the \ch{NO_x} concentration in ambient lab air, it should be
no more than a few \si{ppb}. This is far below the detection limit of
a `longpath' DOAS instrument with a pathlength of
\SI{8.6}{\centi\meter} and a LED peak at $\lambda \approx
\SI{290}{\nano\meter}$.

\subsubsection{Results}
\label{sec:ozone-results}

As a zeroth, qualitative experiment we turned on the generator
and succeeded in perceiving an Ozone signal. After that we shut down the generator
for one week. The startup behaviour afterwards can be seen in
Figuer~\ref{fig:long-stop}. It shows that the generator takes about
\SI{35}{\minute} before it reaches its stable plateau of around
\SI{250}{ppb} Ozone. During this experiment the flow was constantly
set to $\Phi_{\ch{O_3}} = \SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}$. It stands to
argue that the startup time could be shortened by increasing the flow,
however, as shall be seen shortly, if the
generator is used regularly, this procedure seems unnecessary.

    generator.}
  \label{fig:long-stop}
\end{figure}

After determining the longtime behaviour, we were interested in
short term pauses. For that reason we stopped the generator (after it
had stabilized) for {\nfrac{} 1/2} \si{hour}, \SI{1}{\hour},
\SI{2}{\hour} and \SI{4}{\hour} and gauged the startup time. The
result can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:multiple-stop}
lefthandside. Since the time resolution of the DOAS instrument is
rather coarse the only safe statement is, that even after a
\SI{4}{\hour} stop the concentration climbed back up to around
\SI{200}{ppb} after \SI{5}{\minute}. So it stands to reason, that if
the device is used regularly a prolonged startup time should not be an
issue, even if one sticks to the constant flow of $\Phi_{\ch{O3}} =
\SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}$.

As compared to the Ozone level in Figure~\ref{fig:long-stop}, the
plateau seems to lie slightly lower in this second experiment. The
reason for this lies most probably in outer conditions such as the
temperature in the laboratory, which changed rather drastically from
day to day, as the experiments were conducted in November and
December.\todo{perhaps reevaluate?}

    \SI{10}{\milli\ampere} to \SI{17}{\milli\ampere}.}
  \label{fig:multiple-stop}
\end{figure}

After having analyzed the startup procedure, we wanted to gauge the
qualitative influence of the power supply current of the Mercury lamp
on the Ozone concentration. Beforehand it was not clear whether a
higher current would increase or decrease the Ozone production rate,
as, as was described in Section~\ref{sec:theory-ozone}, we did not
know how a change in power would transform the power distribution on
the different Mercury lines. We recorded a time series while switching
between the two possible currents, \SI{10}{\milli\ampere} and
\SI{17}{\milli\ampere}, and yielded Figure~\ref{fig:multiple-stop}
righthandside. From this we see that we still work in a regime where a
higher current leads to more Ozone. However, this fact is secondary in
nature for our purposes, as we do not wish to maximize the Ozone
output. \SI{200}{ppm} Ozone allows us to minimize the Ozone generator
flow entering the sample air stream, minimizing the effects due to
dillution, while still supplying enough Ozone for the conversion. Thus
any Ozone concentration in this region is well suited for our
purposes, hence we always applied the preset current to the Mercury
lamp.
