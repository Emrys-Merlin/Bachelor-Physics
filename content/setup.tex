\section{Converter setup}
\label{sec:setup}

Since the general setup was comparable for most
of the measurements, I decided to collect it here for
conciseness. The first experiments used a Longpath-DOAS instrument, as
it allowed for a precise ozone measurement. Afterwards I transferred
to a CE-DOAS instrument, because of its better localisation and
nitrogen oxides detection capabilities.

\subsection{Ozone generator setup}
\label{sec:ozone-setup}

As a proof of concept I built the ozone generator on a wooden board as
can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:setup}. As described in
Section~\ref{sec:requirements}, the lab air is first filtered and then
sent through an alluminium coated tube containing a Pen-Ray mercury
lamp (Model 11SC-1). It has a lighted length of
\SI{53.8}{\milli\meter} and primary emission band at
\SI{254}{\nano\meter}. The mercury lamp's spectrum is not perfect for
my purpose as its strongest emission is in the ozone dissociation
wavelength range, whereas the lamp has almost no energy output below
the Oxygen dissociation limit (c.\,f.~\cite{lamp}). However, since the
Oxygen concentration in ambient air is so high, I still expect enough
ozone to be produced. In order to make sure that the \ch{N2O} is
completely converted to \ch{NO2}, there is a \SI{3}{\meter} teflon
tube behind the lamp. Afterwards the ozone enriched air passes another
Silica gel filter and is then expected to be \ch{NO_x} free.

In order to be able to measure the ozone production a cuvette is
added, which can be entered in the light path of a Longpath-DOAS
instrument (cf.\ Fig.~\ref{fig:cuvette}). The length of the lightpath
through the cuvette is \SI{8.7}{\centi\meter}.

The Pen-Ray power source can switch the current between
\SI{10}{\milli\ampere} and \SI{17}{\milli\ampere}. If not stated
otherwise the measurements were performed at \SI{10}{\milli\ampere}.
Furthermore the flow $\Phi_{\ch{O 3}}$ can be set via a flowmeter
between \num{0} and \SI{0.3}{\liter\per\minute}. The lowest stable
positive flow is \SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}.

\end{figure}

The cuvette was entered into the ligthpath of a Longpath-DOAS
instrument (attached to an Amundsen telescope located at the rooftop
laboratory at the IUP building). Since I expected rather high ozone
concentrations, I forewent the advantage of a cavity enhanced
pathlength. The upside of this setup was that the instrument contains
a laser driven light source which together with appropriate filters
emits at a wavelength of $\lambda \approx \SI{290}{\nano\meter}$. As
mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:theory-ozone}, ozone has a strong
absorption cross section in this region, which made it possible to
determine the concentration very precisely. The used spectrograph has
2048 channels and is calibrated to a wavelength region of \num{268} to
\SI{312}{\nano\meter}.

\subsection{Inclusion into a CE-DOAS instrument}
\label{sec:inclusion}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \caption{Schematic of EnviMeS CE-DOAS instrument with \ch{NO} to
    \ch{NO2} converter.}
  \label{fig:envimes-schematic}
\end{figure}

After the above setup was tested the converter was added to an
existing CE-DOAS instrument. The instrument was already supplied with
an \ch{O3} generator, but lacked a Silica gel filter, which was
added. The instrument can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:envimes}. Figure~\ref{fig:envimes-schematic} contains
a slightly simplified schematic view of the interior. Zero air is
used to generate the ozone, since it is already sufficientyl trace gas
free (except for \ch{N2O}). After the mercury lamp there is a
\SI{1}{\meter} reaction tube before the silica filter follows. After
that there is an ozone bypass valve, which is operated
electromechanically and allows for the switch between an ozone free and
an ozone enriched air flow in the cavity. The sample air (with or
without ozone) passes a \SI{10}{\meter} reaction path. In later
experiments the length of the reaction path was varied to measure the
influence on the \ch{NO} conversion (c.\,f.\
Sec.~\ref{sec:requirements} for the theory and Sec.~\ref{sec:no} for
measurements). The total flow $\Phi$ can be adapted, but was always
set to \SI{2}{\liter\per\minute}. The ozone flow can be adapted (as
in Sec.~\ref{sec:ozone-setup}) from 0 to
\SI{0.3}{\liter\per\minute}. The lowest stable positive flow is
\SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}. In order to determine the ozone production rate
this flow was varied. When actual \ch{NO} or \ch{NO_x} measurements
were performed the flow was fixed to \SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}.

The light source of the instrument is a led with maximum intensity at
$\lambda \approx \SI{444}{\nano\meter}$. The effective pathlength
$L_0$ of the cavity had a maximum at this wavelength of
\SI{1.3}{\kilo\meter}. A plot of the pathlength can be found in
Figure~\ref{fig:pathlength}. The spectrograph has \num{2048} channels
and is calibrated to a wavelength region of \num{395} to
\SI{490}{\nano\meter}.
