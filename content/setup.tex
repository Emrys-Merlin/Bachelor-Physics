\section{Converter setup}
\label{sec:setup}

Since the general setup was comparable for most
of the measurements, it is described here for
conciseness. The first experiments used a Shortpath-DOAS instrument, as
it allowed for a precise ozone measurement at high
concentrations. Afterwards, the setup was transferred
to an ICAD instrument, because of its better localisation and
nitrogen oxides detection capabilities.

\subsection{Ozone generator setup}
\label{sec:ozone-setup}

As a proof of concept for this thesis the ozone generator was first
set up on a wooden board as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:setup}. As
described in Section~\ref{sec:requirements}, the lab air is first
filtered and then sent through an aluminium coated tube containing a
Pen-Ray mercury lamp (Model 11SC-1). It has a lighted length of
\SI{53.8}{\milli\meter}, primary emission band at
\SI{253.6}{\nano\meter} and additional some weaker emissions which can
be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:hg}. The only other important one for the
setup is the one at \SI{184.9}{\nano\meter}. The mercury lamp's
spectrum is not perfect for my purpose as its strongest emission is in
the ozone dissociation wavelength range, whereas the lamp has almost
no energy output below the oxygen dissociation limit
(c.\,f.~\cite{lamp}). However, since the oxygen concentration in
ambient air is so high, it still produces enough ozone. In order to
make sure that the simultaneously dissociated \ch{N2O} is completely
converted to \ch{NO2}, there is a \SI{3}{\meter} teflon tube behind
the lamp. Afterwards, the ozone enriched air passes another silica gel
filter and is then tested to be \ch{NO_x} free.

    non-linear scale on the intensity axis. The plot was taken out
    of~\cite{lamp}.}
  \label{fig:hg}
\end{figure}
In order to be able to measure the ozone production a cuvette is
added, which can be entered in the light path of a Shortpath-DOAS
instrument (cf.\ Fig.~\ref{fig:cuvette}). The length of the lightpath
through the cuvette is \SI{8.7}{\centi\meter}.

The Pen-Ray power source can switch the current between
\SI{10}{\milli\ampere} and \SI{17}{\milli\ampere}. If not stated
otherwise the measurements were performed at \SI{10}{\milli\ampere}.
Furthermore the flow $\Phi_{\ch{O 3}}$ can be set via a flowmeter
between \num{0} and \SI{0.3}{\liter\per\minute}. The lowest stable
positive flow is \SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}.

\end{figure}

The cuvette was entered into the ligthpath of a Shortpath-DOAS
instrument (it used the Amundsen LP-DOAS setup located at the rooftop
laboratory at the IUP building). Due to the high \ch{O3}
concentrations a single path measurement was sufficient at a UV
wavelength range. A laser driven light source (ldls) together with
appropriate filters emitred thus at the required wavelength of
$\lambda \approx \SI{290}{\nano\meter}$. As mentioned in
Section~\ref{sec:theory-ozone}, ozone has a strong absorption cross
section in this region, which made it possible to determine the
concentration very precisely. The used spectrograph (Acton 300i +
Roper Scientific CCD Camera) has 2048 channels
and is calibrated to a wavelength region of \num{268} to
\SI{312}{\nano\meter}.

\subsection{Inclusion into an ICAD instrument}
\label{sec:inclusion}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/InstrumentEdited_small.jpg}
  \caption{ICAD instrument with \ch{NO} to \ch{NO2}
    converter.}
  \label{fig:envimes}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/envimes_setup.eps}
  \caption{Schematic of the \ch{NO_x} ICAD instrument with \ch{NO} to
    \ch{NO2} converter.}
  \label{fig:envimes-schematic}
\end{figure}

After the above setup was tested, the converter plus the silica gel
filter was added to an existing ICAD instrument. The instrument can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:envimes}. Figure~\ref{fig:envimes-schematic} contains
a slightly simplified schematic view of the interior. Zero air is used
to generate the ozone, since it is already sufficientyl trace gas free
(except for \ch{N2O}). After the mercury lamp there is a
\SI{1}{\meter} reaction tube before the silica filter
follows. Following that there is an ozone bypass valve, which is
operated electromechanically and allows for the switch between an
ozone free and an ozone enriched air flow in the measurement cell. The sample
air (with or without ozone) passes a \SI{10}{\meter} reaction path. In
later experiments the length of the reaction path was varied to
measure the influence on the \ch{NO} conversion (c.\,f.\
Sec.~\ref{sec:requirements} for the theory and Sec.~\ref{sec:no} for
measurements). The total flow $\Phi$ can be adapted, but was always
set to \SI{2}{\liter\per\minute}. The ozone flow can be adapted (as in
Sec.~\ref{sec:ozone-setup}) from 0 to \SI{0.3}{\liter\per\minute}. The
lowest stable positive flow is \SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}. In order
to determine the ozone production rate this flow was varied. When
actual \ch{NO} or \ch{NO_x} measurements were performed the flow was
fixed to \SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}.

The light source of the instrument is a led with maximum intensity at
$\lambda \approx \SI{444}{\nano\meter}$. The effective pathlength
$L_0$ of the measurement cell had a maximum at this wavelength of
\SI{1.3}{\kilo\meter}. A plot of the pathlength can be found in
Figure~\ref{fig:pathlength}. The spectrograph (Avantes AVA
AvaBench-75-ULS2048L) has \num{2048} channels and is calibrated to a
wavelength region of \num{395} to \SI{490}{\nano\meter}.
