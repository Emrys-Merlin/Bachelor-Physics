\section{Converter setup}
\label{sec:setup}

\subsection{Ozone generator setup}
\label{sec:ozone-setup}

As a proof of concept we built the Ozone generator on a wooden board
as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:setup}. As described in
Section~\ref{sec:requirements}, the lab air was first filtered and
then sent through an alluminium coated tube containting a Pen-Ray
Mercury lamp (Model 11SC-1). It has a lighted length of
\SI{53.8}{\milli\meter} and primary energy at
\SI{254}{\nano\meter}. The primary energy setting is not perfect for
our purpose as it is directly at the Ozone dissociation wavelength,
whereas the lamp has almost no energy output at the Oxygen
dissociation wavelength. However, since the Oxygen concentration in
ambient air is so high, we still expect enough Ozone to be
produced. 
To make sure the superfluous \ch{NO} is completely converted to
\ch{NO2}, we introduce a \SI{3}{\meter} teflon tube. Afterwards the
Ozone enriched air passes another Silica gel filter and is expected to
then be \ch{NO_x} free.

To be able to measure the Ozone production after the last filter a
cuvette is added, which can be entered in the light path of a
Longpath-DOAS instrument (cf.\ Fig.~\ref{fig:cuvette}). The length of
the lightpath through the cuvette is \SI{10}{\centi\meter}. 

The Pen-Ray power source could switch the current between
\SI{10}{\milli\ampere} and \SI{17}{\milli\ampere}.  Furthermore the
flow $\Phi_{\ch{O 3}}$ can be set via the flowmeter between \num{0}
and \SI{0.3}{\liter\per\minute}. The lowest stable positive flow is
\SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}.

The cuvette is entered into the ligthpath of a longpath DOAS
instrument (attached to an Amundsen telescope located at the height
laboratory at the IUP building). Since we expect rather high Ozone
concentrations, we forgo the advantage of a cavity enhanced
pathlength. The upside of this setup is that the instrument contains
a UV led emitting at a wavelength of $\lambda =
\SI{290}{\nano\meter}$. As mentioned in
Section~\ref{sec:theory-ozone}, Ozone has a strong absorption cross
section in this region, which allows us to determine the concentration
very precisely. 

The used spectrograph has 2048 channesl and is calibrated to a
wavelength region of \num{268} to \SI{312}{\nano\meter}. This leads to
a resolution of \SI{0.021}{\nano\meter}.

\subsection{Inclusion into a CE-DOAS instrument}
\label{sec:inclusion}

    converter. On the upper left part the Pen-Ray lamp with
    powersupply can be seen. Below the powersupply partly covered by
    styrofoam is the additional Silica gel filter. In the lower half
    one can see the cavity with spectrometer and \SI{10}{\meter}
    reaction path rolled up.}
  \label{fig:envimes}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/envimes_setup.png}
  \caption{Schematic of EnviMeS CE-DOAS instrument with \ch{NO} to
    \ch{NO2} converter.}
  \label{fig:envimes-schematic}
\end{figure}

After the above setup was tested the converter was added to an
existing CE-DOAS instrument (EnviMeS SN:2014002).  The instrument was
already supplied with an \ch{O3} generator, but lacked a Silica gel
filter, which was added. The inside of the instrument can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:envimes}. Since it is optimized for space, it is
difficult, if not impossible, to extract the setup from this
view. Therefore Figure~\ref{fig:envimes-schematic} contains a slightly
simplified schematic view of the instrument. The zero air
input\todo{write zero air somewhere in theory} is used to generate the
Ozone, since it is already filtered. After the Mercury lamp there is a
\SI{1}{\meter} reaction path before the silica filter follows. After
that we have an Ozone bypass valve, which is operated
electromechanically and allows us to switch between an Ozone free and
an Ozone enriched air flow in the cavity. The sample air (with or
without Ozone) passes a \SI{10}{\meter} reaction path. In later
experiments the length of the reaction path is varied to measure the
influence on the \ch{NO} conversion (c.\,f.\
Sec.~\ref{sec:requirements} for the theory and Sec.~\ref{sec:no} for
measurements). The current for the Pen-Ray lamp is fixed. The total
flow $\Phi$ can be adapted, but was always set to
\SI{2}{\liter\per\minute}. The Ozone flow can be adapted (as in
Sec.~\ref{sec:ozone-setup}) from 0 to \SI{0.3}{\liter\per\minute}. The
lowest stable positive flow is \SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}. To
determine the Ozone production rate this flow is varied. When actual
\ch{NO} or \ch{NO_x}\todo{define NOx somewhere} measurements are
performed the flow is fixed to \SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}.

The ligth source of the instrument is a LED with maximum intensity at
$\lambda = \SI{444}{\nano\meter}$. The effective pathlength $L_0$ of
the cavity has a maximum at this wavelength of
\SI{1.3}{\kilo\meter}. A plot of the pathlength can be found in
Figure~\ref{fig:pathlength}. The spectrograph as \num{2048} channesl
and is calibrated to a wavelength region of \num{395} to
\SI{490}{\nano\meter}. This leads to a resolution of
\SI{0.046}{\nano\meter}.
