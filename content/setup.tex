\section{Converter setup}
\label{sec:setup}

Since the general measurement instrument setup was comparable for most
of our measurements, we decided to collect this setup herefor
conciseness. The first experiments used a Longpath-DOAS instrument, as
it allowed for a precise Ozone measurement. Afterwards we transferred
to a CE-DOAS instrument, because of its better localisation and
Nitrogen Oxides detection capabilities.

\subsection{Ozone generator setup}
\label{sec:ozone-setup}

As a proof of concept we built the Ozone generator on a wooden board
as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:setup}. As described in
Section~\ref{sec:requirements}, the lab air was first filtered and
then sent through an alluminium coated tube containing a Pen-Ray
Mercury lamp (Model 11SC-1). It has a lighted length of
\SI{53.8}{\milli\meter} and primary energy at
\SI{254}{\nano\meter}. This energy setting is not perfect for
our purpose as it is directly at the Ozone dissociation wavelength,
whereas the lamp has almost no energy output at the Oxygen
dissociation wavelength. However, since the Oxygen concentration in
ambient air is so high, we still expect enough Ozone to be
produced. 
To make sure the \ch{N2O} is completely converted to
\ch{NO2}, we introduce a \SI{3}{\meter} teflon tube. Afterwards the
Ozone enriched air passes another Silica gel filter and is then
expected to be \ch{NO_x} free.

To be able to measure the Ozone production after the last filter a
cuvette was added, which coul be entered in the light path of a
Longpath-DOAS instrument (cf.\ Fig.~\ref{fig:cuvette}). The length of
the lightpath through the cuvette is \SI{8.7}{\centi\meter}. 

The Pen-Ray power source could switch the current between
\SI{10}{\milli\ampere} and \SI{17}{\milli\ampere}.  Furthermore the
flow $\Phi_{\ch{O 3}}$ coul be set via the flowmeter between \num{0}
and \SI{0.3}{\liter\per\minute}. The lowest stable positive flow was
\SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}.

\end{figure}

The cuvette was entered into the ligthpath of a Longpath-DOAS
instrument (attached to an Amundsen telescope located at the height
laboratory at the IUP building). Since we expected rather high Ozone
concentrations, we forewent the advantage of a cavity enhanced
pathlength. The upside of this setup was that the instrument contains
a UV led emitting at a wavelength of $\lambda \approx
\SI{290}{\nano\meter}$. As mentioned in
Section~\ref{sec:theory-ozone}, Ozone has a strong absorption cross
section in this region, which allowed us to determine the
concentration very precisely.  The used spectrograph has 2048 channesl
and is calibrated to a wavelength region of \num{268} to
\SI{312}{\nano\meter}.

\subsection{Inclusion into a CE-DOAS instrument}
\label{sec:inclusion}

    powersupply can be seen. Below the powersupply partly covered by
    styrofoam is the additional Silica gel filter. In the lower half
    one can see the cavity with spectrometer and \SI{10}{\meter}
    reaction path rolled up.}
  \label{fig:envimes}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/envimes_setup.eps}
  \caption{Schematic of EnviMeS CE-DOAS instrument with \ch{NO} to
    \ch{NO2} converter.}
  \label{fig:envimes-schematic}
\end{figure}

After the above setup was tested the converter was added to an
existing CE-DOAS instrument (EnviMeS SN:2014002).  The instrument was
already supplied with an \ch{O3} generator, but lacked a Silica gel
filter, which was added. The inside of the instrument can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:envimes}. Since it is optimized for space, it is
difficult, if not impossible, to extract the setup from this
view. Therefore Figure~\ref{fig:envimes-schematic} contains a slightly
simplified schematic view of the instrument. The zero air input was
used to generate the Ozone, since it had already installed all the
necessary filters. After the Mercury lamp there was a \SI{1}{\meter}
reaction path before the silica filter followed. After that we had an
Ozone bypass valve, which was operated electromechanically and allowed
us to switch between an Ozone free and an Ozone enriched air flow in
the cavity. The sample air (with or without Ozone) passed a
\SI{10}{\meter} reaction path. In later experiments the length of the
reaction path was varied to measure the influence on the \ch{NO}
conversion (c.\,f.\ Sec.~\ref{sec:requirements} for the theory and
Sec.~\ref{sec:no} for measurements). The current for the Pen-Ray lamp
was fixed. The total flow $\Phi$ could be adapted, but was always set to
\SI{2}{\liter\per\minute}. The Ozone flow could be adapted (as in
Sec.~\ref{sec:ozone-setup}) from 0 to \SI{0.3}{\liter\per\minute}. The
lowest stable positive flow was \SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}. To
determine the Ozone production rate this flow was varied. When actual
\ch{NO} or \ch{NO_x} measurements were performed the flow was fixed to
\SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}.

The light source of the instrument was a led with maximum intensity at
$\lambda \approx \SI{444}{\nano\meter}$. The effective pathlength $L_0$ of
the cavity had a maximum at this wavelength of
\SI{1.3}{\kilo\meter}. A plot of the pathlength can be found in
Figure~\ref{fig:pathlength}. The spectrograph had \num{2048} channesl
and was calibrated to a wavelength region of \num{395} to
\SI{490}{\nano\meter}.
