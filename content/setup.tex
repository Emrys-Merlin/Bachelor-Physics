\subsection{Ozone generator setup}
\label{sec:ozone-setup}

As a proof of concept we built the Ozone generator on a wooden board
as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:setup}. As described in
Section~\ref{sec:requirements}, the lab air was first filtered and
then sent through an alluminium coated tube containting a Pen-Ray
Hg-Lamp\todo{find out more about it}. To make sure the superfluous
\ch{NO} is completely to \ch{NO2}, we introduce a \SI{3}{\meter}
teflon tube. Afterwards the Ozone enriched air passed another Silica
gel filter and is expected to then be \ch{NO_x} free.

To be able to measure the Ozone production after the last filter a
cuvette was added, which could be entered in the light path of a
longpath DOAS instrument (cf.\ Fig.~\ref{fig:cuvette}). The length of
the lightpath through the cuvette is \SI{10}{\centi\meter}. 

The Pen-Ray power source could switch the current between
\SI{}{\ampere} and \SI{}{\ampere}\todo{find out used
currents}. Furthermore the Flow $\Phi_{\ch{O 3}}$ could be set via the
flowmeter between \num{0} and \SI{0.3}{\liter\per\minute}. The lowest
stable flow higher than \SI{0}{\liter\per\minute} was
\SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}.nn

\subsection{Inclusion into a CE-DOAS instrument}
\label{sec:inclusion}

    powersupply can be seen. Below the powersupply partly covered by
    styrofoam is the additional Silica gel filter. In the lower half
    one can see the cavity with spectrometer and \SI{10}{\meter}
    reaction path rolled up.}

  \caption{Schematic of EnviMeS CE-DOAS instrument with \ch{NO} to
    \ch{NO2} converter.}
  \label{fig:envimes-schematic}
\end{figure}

After the above setup was tested the converter was added to an
existing CE-DOAS instrument (EnviMeS SN:2014002)\todo{technical data
  of envimes}. The instrument was already supplied with an \ch{O3}
generator, but lacked a Silica gel filter, which was added. The inside
of the instrument can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:envimes}. Since it
was optimized for space, it is difficult, if not impossible, to extract
the setup from this view. Therefore Figure~\ref{fig:envimes-schematic}
contains a slightly simplified schematic view of the instrument. The
Zero Air input\todo{write zero air somewhere in theory} is used to
generate the Ozone, since it is already filtered. After the Hg-lamp
there is a \SI{1}{\meter} reaction path before the silica filter
follows. After that we have a Ozone bypass valve, which is operated
electromechanically and allows us to switch between an Ozone free and
an Ozone enriched air flow in the cavity. The sample air (with or
without Ozone) passes a \SI{10}{\meter} reaction path. In later
experiments the length of the reaction path was varied to measure the
influence on the \ch{NO} conversion (c.\,f.\
Sec.~\ref{sec:requirements} for the theory and Sec.~\ref{sec:no} for
measurements). The current for the Pen-Ray lamp was fixed. The total
flow $\Phi$ could be adapted, but was always set to
\SI{2}{\liter\per\minute}. The Ozone flow could be adapted (as in
Sec.~\ref{sec:ozone-setup}) from 0 to \SI{0.3}{\liter\per\minute}. The
lowest stable positive flow was \SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}. To
determine the Ozone production rate this flow was varied. When actual
\ch{NO} or \ch{NO_x}\todo{define NOx somewhere} measurements were
performed the flow was fixed to \SI{0.03}{\liter\per\minute}.
