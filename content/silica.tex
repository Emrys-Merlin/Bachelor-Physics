\subsection{Silica gel influence on ozone and nitrogen dioxide concentration}
\label{sec:silica}

\subsubsection{Setup}
\label{sec:silica-setup}

In this experiment I wanted to deduce the influence of the silica gel
filter, installed behind the ozone generator, on the \ch{NO2} and
\ch{O3} concentration. For this I used the updated cavity as described
in Section~\ref{sec:inclusion}. This setup was necessary as the
expected \ch{NO2} concentrations were so low that they were
undetectable by the used `longpath' instrument (at the utilized
wavelength range). The disadvantage of this procedure lies in the
fact that the ozone absorption in the visible spectrum is much weaker
than in the UV spectrum. Therefore I had to accept higher
uncertainties in the DOAS fit for this species.

Additionally, I did not measure the output of the generator directly,
as the ozone concentration would have been so high as to damage the
cavity's main stream pump. Therefore I used a setup as depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:ozone-flow-setup}, which used zero air cartridges at
both the sample air and the zero air input. This allowed for the
dilution of the ozone enriched air by mixing it with the `sample
air'. By utilizing the second zero air cartridge I could guarantee the
measured air to be sufficiently trace gas free and hence kept
additional errors down.

I took three test series. For all of them the total flow was fixed to
$\Phi = \SI{2}{\liter\per\minute}$ and the ozone flow $\Phi_{\ch{O3}}$
was varied between \num{0} and \SI{0.3}{\liter\per\minute}. The first
two series were recorded while increasing the ozone flow, whereas the
last one was measured while decreasing the flow. This was done to
check for any hysteresis effects in the silica gel. Furthermore, for
the second series the silica gel filter had been removed. For each
flow I waited until the concentrations had stabilized before averaging
over several minutes.

\subsubsection{Results}
\label{sec:silica-results}

The result of the experiment can be found in
Figure~\ref{fig:o3-flow}. The left-hand side describes the ozone
concentration and it can be seen that hysteresis effects in the silica
gel are negligible. Within the errors the ascendingly and descendingly
measured ozone concentrations coincide. The ozone concentrations
measured without silica gel filter differ from the other two, however
differently from what I expected beforehand. The gel should adsorb
some of the ozone, so it sounds reasonable that the absolute ozone
concentration \emph{without} filter should be higher than the one
\emph{with} filter. However, as can be seen, I measured exactly the
opposite. One reason for this might be the change in the flow
resistance leading to a change in the dillution ratio of the ozone.

Looking at the right-hand side of Figure~\ref{fig:o3-flow}, the
strong influence of the silica gel on the \ch{NO2} levels is obvious. With
filter there is no \ch{NO2} signal, without it there are concentrations
reaching up to \SI{14}{ppb}. This result underlines the stark
improvement of the generator by introducing an additional filtering
stage. I do not have to compensate for additional \ch{NO2} signals,
but can work with nitrogen dioxide free generator air. The filter
seems to be a very effective tool to clean the generator air.
